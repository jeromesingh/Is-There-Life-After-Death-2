  <p class="bible">Genesis 2:15-17 KJV  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
   (16)  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:  (17)  But of the
  tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
  surely die.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">Genesis 3:1 KJV  Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said
  unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

</p>

  <p class="bible" >Genesis 3:19-24 KJV  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast
  thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  (20)  And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she
  was the mother of all living.  (21)  Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed
  them.  (22)  And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put
  forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  (23)  Therefore the LORD God sent him
  forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  (24)  So he drove out the man; and he
  placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the
  tree of life.

<h5>Can Our Dead Speak to us?</h5>

<p class="text">The work of dealing with familiar spirits was pronounced an abomination to the Lord, and was solemnly forbidden under
penalty of death. Leviticus 19:31; 20:27. The very name of witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can
hold intercourse with evil spirits is regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But spiritualism, which numbers its converts
by hundreds of thousands, yea, by millions, which has made its way into scientific circles, which has invaded churches,
and has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in the courts of kings— this mammoth deception is but a revival, in
a new disguise, of the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old. <b> Great Controversy 556 </b>

</p>

<p class="bible">Ecclesiastes 9:4-6 KJV  For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a
dead lion.  (5)  For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a
reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.  (6)  Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

  </p>

<p class="bible" >Ecclesiastes 9:11 KJV  I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time
and chance happeneth to them all.

</p>

<p class="bible">Numbers 25:1-3 KJV  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
 (2)  And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their
gods.  (3)  And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 106:28 KJV  They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 10:20 KJV  But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to
God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Samuel 28:3-7 KJV  Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own
city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.  (4)  And the Philistines
gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in
Gilboa.  (5)  And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.  (6)  And
when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.  (7)  Then
said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Chronicles 10:13 KJV  So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of
the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;
